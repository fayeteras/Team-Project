Brief summary...
The database’s current function is to save the file info to the User, Post, and Comment classes. 
All the adding and deleting of Users, Posts, and Comments happen in their respective classes. 
If you find that this doesn’t work and wish to move all of the adding and deleting to the database, please do so bc we aren’t 100% on it. 
We have added a few helpful comments that will hopefully guide you all, but sorry if they are vague.
We have added the 3 .txt files for users, posts, and comments. each file has expected formats with some examples.
The interfaces and (hopefully prior to your meetup) the User class is completed, so the database, post, and comment classes are left.

EDIT (also from Sean)
I completed the User class. I didn't test it, mostly because it's so late and just no.
Even though it looks like a lot of the stuff in the repository so far was updated by me,
please know that Savni made every interface and provided me with a couple methods on the User class.
I only completed the User class and made comments on the interfaces.
